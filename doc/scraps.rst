The lighting simulator: SimPixel
--------------------------------

BLiPS has a sibling project, SimPixel, which lets you preview your
lighting animations in any modern browser.  This is extremely convenient as it
allows you develop and test animations in your browser and then deploy them to
your hardware installation when you know they are ready.
